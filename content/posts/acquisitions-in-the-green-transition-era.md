Climate change is increasingly impacting people's lives, disrupting national economies and
transforming ecosystems. According to OECD figures, there is a need for significant
infrastructure investment compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In this context,
corporate takeovers may foster this needed green transition, as they allow firms to acquire
external technological resources (such as patent rights), to complement internal research and
development (R&amp;D) projects, or to accelerate the innovation process. However, due to factors
such as information-related frictions, acquirer firms may potentially face challenges when
identifying suitable target firms and valuing their resources, technology and synergy potential,
particularly in deals which are outside their core areas of expertise. These challenges may
effectively compromise the suitability of technological acquisitions as a way to foster the green
transition.


Using a dataset of completed control acquisition deals over the period of 2009-2020 from 23
OECD countries, this research examines how green technology and sustainable innovation can
influence the likelihood of acquisition between firms with different technological expertise,
changes related to the introduction of the Paris Agreement, as well as post-acquisition
innovation performance.


The paper finds that green acquirors (i.e., firms with green patents) are more inclined to enter
into acquisition deals with green firms due to their technological proximity and informational
advantages before and after the Paris Agreement. Second, after the Paris Agreement, green
acquisitions by non-green acquirors increased especially from those in climate policy-relevant
sectors and based in countries with low environmental standards. Third, after the Paris
Agreement, green acquisitions do not show any significant impact on their post-acquisition
innovation performances, raising concerns related to greenwashing behavior by investing firms.
