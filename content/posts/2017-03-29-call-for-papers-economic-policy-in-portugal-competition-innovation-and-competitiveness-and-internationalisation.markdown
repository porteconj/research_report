The Portuguese Economic Journal is launching a call for papers for a special issue on** Economic Policy in Portugal: Competition, Innovation, and Competitiveness and Internationalisation.** Submissions are welcome from 16 to 30 September 2017. Papers accepted for publication will be awarded a Eur. 3,000 prize sponsored by Gabinete de Estratégia e Estudos of the Portuguese Ministry of Economy. You can find more information on the call for papers on the [official website](https://pascal.iseg.ulisboa.pt/~pej/cfp2017.html).

Following the Great Recession and its aftershocks, it is clear that long-run structural deficiencies would make life uncomfortable for less-productive countries participating in international markets. Short-run macroeconomic imbalances may be corrected with temporary, but painful adjustment measures, but they will be recurrent – as a chronic disease – if growth convergence is not resumed. This is not an easy task in a globalised world where a small open economy such as Portugal aims to implement economic policies to enhance productivity and improve the competitiveness of its firms, so that economic growth is accelerated and population’s welfare is raised. This is why long-run microeconomic growth factors are so important. This is true for a small open economy like Portugal, but there are lessons that can be learned and adapted to any other geography. This special issue of PEJ aims at gathering innovative empirical, theoretical, and especially policy-oriented research on the Portuguese economy in three fields: (i) competition, (ii) innovation, and (iii) competitiveness and internationalisation.
