title = "The real effects of FinTech lending on SMEs"

+++
Despite the attention that FinTech has received over the past years, the drivers and consequences of FinTech disruptive forces on financial markets remain open to debate. For example, an important open question relates to the impact that FinTech lending availability has on SMEs financing and investment policies. In our paper we address this question using access to a unique data set from a FinTech platform for which we have the universe of loan applications.

We find that FinTech serves larger, high profitability SMEs, who already have access to bank credit. At the same time, firms who access FinTech lending have lower interest coverage ratios, less unused debt, and less availability of collateral. Therefore, these firms may switch to FinTech to finance their growth without depleting their debt capacity. Finally, firms who access the FinTech platform have relationships with banks with less liquid assets, stable funds, and capital, suggestive of a desire to reduce exposure to lower quality banks.

In exploring the real effects of obtaining FinTech debt we restrict our analysis to firms who apply to the FinTech platform, thus comparing accepted versus rejected applicants. We find that firms increase assets, employment and sales following FinTech lending. We also show that firms increase leverage, both short-term and long-term. Interestingly, we observe a reduction in the proportion of secured debt. In addition, net of FinTech loans, we find that firms decrease long-term bank debt, and increase short-term bank debt. Finally, we observe that the access to the FinTech platform allows SMEs to diversify their pool of lenders. Firms add new bank relationships and reduce their dependence on a single bank.

Overall, our findings suggest that FinTech lending allows firms to grow by expanding their debt capacity, and at the same time preserve financial flexibility and reduce their exposure to banking shocks.
