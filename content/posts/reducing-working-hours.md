The debate on if and how to shorten the length of the working week has strengthened in the past years, especially because of the Covid pandemic.[\[1\]](applewebdata://5964DED2-1511-4969-9AE0-9A2054A7F038#_ftn1) Regulating working hours can have a direct impact on first-order economic outcomes such as labour cost, employment, and productivity, but also workersâ€™ health and welfare. Since 1995, there have been five national reforms reducing standard working time in European countries.[\[2\]](applewebdata://5964DED2-1511-4969-9AE0-9A2054A7F038#_ftn2) Aside from the (in)famous French 35-hour reform, an interesting yet understudied case study is that of the 1996 Portuguese reform.

Portugal began significantly reforming the length of its working week in 1991.[\[3\]](applewebdata://5964DED2-1511-4969-9AE0-9A2054A7F038#_ftn3) At the same time, a non-binding agreement was made to further cut hours to 40h by 1995 through collective agreements, but the gradual reduction occurred only partially. Therefore, in 1996, national legislation cut hours to 40h. This reform provides an ideal case study: i) in only two years, firms had to adjust their standard hours to 40h; ii) because the standard day stayed at 8h, weekly working days went from 6 to 5; iii) contrary to the French reform, it did not entail any compensating measures.[\[4\]](applewebdata://5964DED2-1511-4969-9AE0-9A2054A7F038#_ftn4)

Our results show that working hours decreased significantly in affected firms (relative to firms whose collective agreement already specified 40h). Wages per hour increased significantly, but monthly salaries did not adjust. Theory would argue that an increase in the labour cost would lead to employment loss, yet employment was not significantly affected. We show that more affected sectors experienced significantly higher price growth, suggesting that the higher labour cost was shifted onto consumers. The policy implication is that stricter (and costlier) regulations for firms do not have to be negative for employment insofar as firms have other margins of adjustment. However, this raises other questions, such as the distributional and potentially negative effects for consumers.
