title = "Is multinational firm entry a threat to SMEs?"

+++
The entry of multinational companies (MNCs) into a cluster is likely to affect the competitive environment and, hence, local firms’ strategy and performance. Assuming that MNCs have potential to engender positive effects in the places where they settle, competition with local SMEs can improve their performance. However, local SMEs could also face a changing nature in competition. Product market competition pressure tends to lower prices, thereby forcing local firms to react and increase efficiency. Local firms can no longer be passive recipients of knowledge spillovers as they have to compete with MNCs either on product or factor markets.

Using novel and primary data on local SMEs belonging to the Portuguese furniture production cluster, this study adds to the knowledge on MNCs’ impact on specific regions, by addressing the changing nature of competition and local firm’s strategic responses to IKEA’s entry and its impact on their performance. In particular, this study contributes to the literature on clusters, strategy and MNCs by assessing (i) how local firms, predominantly SMEs, respond to the MNC entry, (ii) which factors explain their strategic response, and (iii) the impact of strategic responses on their performance.

The findings suggest that firms facing an important environmental change – MNC’s entry into their cluster – respond in diverse ways and find alternative pathways to engender performance gains and structural changes into the cluster. Local firms – small producers offering customized products with more added value, using different raw materials and providing delivery and assembly services – response to IKEA’s entry mainly by searching for a distinct positioning based on a differentiation focus strategy whereby specializing in distinct products, value added services and positioning themselves in more restricted markets. IKEA’s entry seems to stimulate upgrading capabilities and boost the sophistication of local firms’ production, moving them into more complex products.
