title = "Wage inequality and firm reorganization when firm competition changes"

+++
This paper studies how increased domestic product market competition induces firms to change their internal organization and how this change affects wage inequality. The paper exploits the _Empresa na Hora_ (Firm On the Spot) program in Portugal as a quasi-natural experiment of a shock to competition. The paper uses detailed employer-employee data for the analysis.

The paper shows that the "Firm On the Spot" program significantly increased firm entry and reduced sales, output and employment of affected incumbents. The negative shock to production following the introduction of the new program induced firms to reorganize by dropping layers. The paper documents that lower sales are associated with flatter hierarchies. With the reduction in the depth of the hierarchy, the span of control of top managers is expected to have increased.

The reduction in hierarchical layers is accompanied by an 8% drop in the average pay ratio between the top and the bottom layer and a 4.4% drop in the 90-50 percentile pay ratio, showing that there are real changes arising from the reorganization. The flattening of firms' hierarchies induced by the reform, carried effects to pay and the career paths of individual workers in incumbent firms.
