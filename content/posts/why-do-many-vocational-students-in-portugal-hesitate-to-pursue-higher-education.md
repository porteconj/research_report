The possession of higher education qualifications is increasingly seen as essential for improving job prospects, safeguarding against unemployment, and securing higher wages. At the same time, a more educated workforce drives the economic and technological advancement of countries. In light of this, successive Portuguese governments have set ambitious targets to widen access to higher education, with specific policies aimed at vocational secondary school students. This group made up 40% of all upper secondary students in 2020-2021. However, a large proportion of these students do not plan to continue their studies beyond secondary school. In 2020-2021, only 24% of vocational students transitioned to higher education, compared to 77% of those in general education – a significant gap.

This study explores the reasons behind the low uptake of higher education among vocational students, despite policy efforts to create dedicated access routes for them. Many vocational students feel unprepared academically and doubt their ability to succeed in higher education. Their focus tends to be on practical skills and entering the workforce as soon as possible, often due to financial pressures and the need for short-term stability. Additionally, many students perceive higher education as unrelated to their chosen career paths, further discouraging them from pursuing it. These barriers are particularly pronounced for students from lower-income backgrounds, for whom immediate employment is often seen as a more attractive option. 

To address these challenges, the study suggests better alignment between vocational education and higher education. However, the study does not address the question of whether pursuing higher education is the best alternative for students finishing vocational secondary education.
