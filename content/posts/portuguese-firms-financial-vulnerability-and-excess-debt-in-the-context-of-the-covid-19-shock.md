title = "Portuguese firms’ financial vulnerability and excess debt in the context of the COVID-19 shock"

+++
The economic shock prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic strongly restricts Portuguese firms’ ability to generate results, contributing to an increase in their financial vulnerability and undermining their capacity to meet credit commitments in the short and medium term.

We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the vulnerable firms’ debt. Firms are defined as financially vulnerable if their operating results are less than twice the amount of interest expenses or if the firm has negative results. We also propose an excess debt measure, computed as the difference between the firm’s current debt and the amount of debt it can bear without entering into vulnerability.

We analyzed two scenarios for the Portuguese economy: a central and a severe scenario, composed from Banco de Portugal’s December 2020 projections.

There is an increase in financially vulnerable firms’ debt and in excess debt over the horizon 2020-2022. However, the debt levels reached are expected to remain below those observed during the sovereign debt crisis, reflecting the increase in financial robustness of Portuguese firms in the period preceding the pandemic crisis.

In 2020, vulnerable firms’ debt is projected to increase by 9 p.p., reaching 31% of the total firms’ debt (see chart). The increase in excess debt is less sharp over the same period, reaching 21% of total debt.

In the central scenario there is a progressive decline of vulnerable firms’ debt and excess debt up to 2022, to levels close to those observed in 2019. In the severe scenario, the share of vulnerable firms’ debt and of excess debt is projected to remain at higher levels in 2022.

The share of vulnerable debt and excess debt is projected to increase more in manufacturing, trade and accommodation and food services sectors. Vulnerable firms have worse liquidity and capitalization ratios than non-vulnerable firms.
