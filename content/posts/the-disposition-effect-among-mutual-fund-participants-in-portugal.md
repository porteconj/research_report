In this paper, we present an empirical analysis addressing the existence of disposition effect (the propensity of investors to sell assets on which they have experienced gains and to hold assets on which they have faced (unrealized) losses) among mutual fund participants in Portugal.

In contrast with the stock market, little attention has been paid to the disposition effect among mutual fund participants. The conclusions of existing studies for mutual funds conflict with those obtained for the stock market. For example, some research claims that investors avoid realizing losses because they dislike admitting that past purchases were mistakes, but delegation reverses this effect by allowing the investor to blame the manager instead. Accordingly, the propensity to realize past gains more than past losses applies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect.

Using a large sample of transaction-level records from a major bank for the period from 1998 to 2017, we find evidence of strong disposition effect among mutual fund investors in Portugal. This finding challenges the conclusions of similar studies conducted for other countries.

Literacy and trading experience seem to weaken the disposition effect exhibited by mutual fund participants, without fully eliminating it. The disposition effect exists in both bull and bear markets, but it is more sizable during periods of positive sentiment. Evidence of the disposition effect persists after accounting for bad emotions, irrational beliefs, redemption fees or the “someone to blame” hypothesis.

These findings have relevant normative implications given that the existence of the disposition effect imposes substantial costs on investors: there are benefits for investors (and the society) from the acquisition of higher levels of literacy.
