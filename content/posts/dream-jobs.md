What makes some jobs better than others? 

The positive effect that a ‘good’ job has on lifetime wage income may be due to a wage jump upon taking the job (i.e., a static effect) or to a faster wage growth after taking the job (i.e., a dynamic effect), and may depend on whether the benefits are portable to another job, as well as on the quality of the match between occupation worker’s skill and ability.

This paper uses 16 years of Portuguese data on firms, workers, and international trade, and finds that internationally active firms provide better experience and opportunities for managers as reflected in steeper sales growth for the former (see Figure 1) and steeper wage growth for the latter (see Figure 2).

Dream jobs are not the same for all workers. Managers and blue-collar workers receive higher wages in internationally active firms because of very different mechanisms. Blue collar workers benefit from wage jumps when moving to an internationally active firm while managers of those firms---and especially more _able_ managers---benefit from higher wage growth that sticks with them when, eventually, moving to a domestic firm.

The gap between the return on international and domestic experience for managers stacks up, over a 10 years horizon, to a wage difference of about 10% to 17% which is quite substantial. As for blue-collar workers the gap is instead negligible.

Dream jobs also play a role at the aggregate level. International experience plays an important role in affecting spatial wage inequalities and the cross-sectional distribution of wages for more senior managers.
